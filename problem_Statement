Air Quality Prediction in Urban Areas.
Challenge: Build a robust air quality prediction system that empowers individuals, communities, and governments to take data-driven actions for a healthier urban environment.
Participants Will:
Collect and Analyze Air Quality Data:
o    Use publicly available datasets such as those from OpenAQ, EPA, or Kaggle.
o    Analyze historical data on pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2) and weather conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed).
Preprocess and Feature Engineer the Data:
o    Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
o    Engineer features like lagged values, pollutant ratios, or weather-pollutant interactions to enhance model predictions.
Build and Train Predictive Models:
o    Train time-series models such as LSTMs, GRUs, or ARIMA to forecast air quality metrics.
o    Alternatively, use regression models like XGBoost or Random Forests for predictive accuracy.
Evaluate and Fine-Tune the Model:
o    Use metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and R2 Score to evaluate model performance.
o    Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
Develop a User-Friendly Dashboard:
o    Create a visualization dashboard (using Dash, Streamlit, or Matplotlib) to display real-time predictions and trends.
o    Include features like pollutant breakdown, historical trends, and future forecasts
